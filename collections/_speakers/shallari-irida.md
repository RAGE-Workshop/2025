    "Irida Shallari is an Assistant Professor at the Sensible Things that Communicate research center at Mid Sweden University. She graduated in 2016 on the European Masters in Embedded Computing Systems from the University of Southampton, UK and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway. In 2019, Irida was awarded the Bronn scholarship for her licentiate thesis in “Intelligence Partitioning for IoT”, while in 2021, she obtained her PhD degree from Mid Sweden University. Her research focused on the design of energy efficient smart camera nodes, considering the optimisation of both the computational and communication burden of the IoT node. Irida has been a visiting researcher at the Blaise Pascal research institute in France and the Ontario Tech University, Canada, while she has obtained several national funds from the Knowledge Foundation and Vinnova. Her research is centered on vision systems, where camera based IoT nodes relying on both traditional and AI-based processing can be deployed as metrology instruments within the Smart Cities and the Industry 4.0 perspectives."
